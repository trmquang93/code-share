# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
Developers need a professional way to share code snippets on social media platforms where plain text formatting is lost and visual appeal is crucial for engagement.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Poor Formatting**: Existing solutions lack beautiful, professional formatting that matches developer tools
2. **Social Media Limitations**: Code shared as plain text loses formatting and visual appeal
3. **Inconsistent Results**: Manual screenshot tools produce inconsistent, unprofessional results
4. **Lack of Customization**: Limited options for matching personal coding aesthetic preferences

## Target User: Social Developer
- Developers who actively share knowledge and tutorials on social media
- Want visually appealing code snippets that stand out in feeds
- Need quick conversion of code to professional-looking images
- Desire consistent, beautiful formatting across shared content

## How It Should Work
1. **Instant Preview**: Paste code and immediately see beautifully formatted preview
2. **Theme Selection**: Choose from 10 popular editor themes (VS Code Dark+, Monokai, Dracula, etc.)
3. **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detect programming language with manual override
4. **One-Click Export**: Export as high-quality PNG/JPG optimized for LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook
5. **Real-Time Updates**: All customizations apply immediately without refresh
