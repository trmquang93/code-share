# Product Requirements Document
## Code Snippet Sharing Website

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Project Vision
Create a web-based platform that enables developers to transform code snippets into beautifully formatted, shareable images optimized for social media platforms.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Developers struggle with two key challenges when sharing code:
- **Poor formatting**: Existing solutions lack the beautiful, professional formatting that developers are accustomed to in their daily development tools
- **Social media limitations**: Code shared as plain text on social platforms loses formatting and visual appeal, reducing engagement and readability

### 1.3 Solution Overview
A single-page web application that displays code snippets within an elegant macOS window interface, offering customizable themes and one-click export to social media-optimized images.

### 1.4 Success Metrics
- **User Engagement**: Time spent customizing and exporting snippets
- **Export Volume**: Number of images successfully generated and downloaded
- **Theme Usage**: Distribution of theme preferences across user base
- **Language Coverage**: Percentage of code snippets successfully auto-detected

## 2. User Stories & Personas

### 2.1 Primary Persona: Social Developer
**Profile**: Developers who actively share knowledge, tutorials, and code examples on social media platforms

**Goals**:
- Share visually appealing code snippets that stand out in social feeds
- Quickly convert code into professional-looking images
- Maintain consistent, beautiful formatting across all shared content

**Pain Points**:
- Plain text code looks unprofessional on social media
- Manual screenshot tools produce inconsistent results
- Existing solutions lack customization options

### 2.2 Core User Stories

**Story 1: Quick Code Sharing**
- As a developer, I want to paste my code and immediately see a beautifully formatted preview
- So that I can quickly assess how my snippet will appear before sharing

**Story 2: Theme Customization**
